# PSF TEST

The ideal PSF, total flux = 1. It has been found we will get the right results with the ideal PSF in the measurement.

But in the real case, the bright stars will be chosen as the PSF. It's non-normalized (total flux != 1) and the images contain lots of noise.

## test
1. **the ideal PFS**: CORRECT!
2. **the non-normalized PSF without noise**: 2 million galaxies, $m$ changes a little, $m \sim 10^{-3}, \Delta m \sim 10^{-3}, c \sim 10^{-5}, \Delta c \sim 10^{-5}$, magnitude $20 \sim 24.5$, noise sigma=60, CFHTLenS-like.
3. **the non-normalized PSF noise**:
