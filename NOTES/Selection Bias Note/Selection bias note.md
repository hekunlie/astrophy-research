## <center>Simulation setup

**Pixel scale**: 0.187 arcsec (CFHTLenS)

**PSF**: Moffat, FWHM=0.7 arcsec, the typical value in CFHTLenS

**Galaxy**: disc-dominated & bulge-dominated (9:1), random walk

**Radius**:

 $$log_e(r_d) = -1.145 - 0.269(i_{814} - 23), \quad  P(r) \propto  r \exp [-(r/a)^\alpha], \quad a= r_d /0.833, \alpha=4/3$$

**PDF of ellipticity**

a. disc: 

$$P(e) = {A e[1- \exp{ (\frac{e-e_{max}}{a}})]}/ [(1+e)(e^2 + e_0^2)^{1/2}], \quad  e_{max}=0.804, e_0 = 0.0256, a = 0.2539$$

b. bulge: 

$$P(e) \propto e \exp{[-be - ce^2]}, \quad b = 2.368, c=6.691$$


**Bulge-to-total ratio**: 

$$ f(ratio) = \exp{[-\frac{{ratio}^2}{2\sigma ^2}]}, \quad \sigma=0.1$$


**Random walk**:

a. CPP: 45 points, max radius = 8

b. galsim: 200 points, half_light_radius and flux are the same as galsim galaxy sample

The \\(SNR_F\\)'sï¼Œorange histogram, are measured from \\( 8 \times 10^6\\) pure noise images (\\(48 \times 48\\)). The blue histogram shows the PDF of \\(SNR_F\\) measured from fitting peaks. The non-fitting \\(SNR_F\\)'s peak at \\(\sim\\) 0 which means no source detection. That confirms to our intuitives. However, as the definition shows, the \\(SNR_F\\) of pure source should be 1 as what the histogram shows. The fitting algorithm constrains the PDF and makes it peaks at 1. As we see, using the fitting one as selection criterion will give rise to selection bias.
